title: Week 1 At Metis Bootcamp - EDA on the MTA, Crazy Turnstiles, & Perfectionism
---

My first week at Metis Bootcamp has flown by, and so far the biggest challenge has been getting this blog set up (just kidding, but it definitely took me much longer than it should have). This week's focus was getting up to speed on several of Python's linchpin data manipulation and analysis packages like numpy, pandas, and matplotlib, with our workflow anchored by a project on MTA subway traffic data.
