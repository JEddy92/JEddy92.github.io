I'm a data science generalist with more than 8 years of experience in data science and analytics roles across blockchain tech, finance, and healthcare. I've been very focused on complex machine learning problems along with team leadership and mentorship. I currently lead a data science team at The Tie, which provides a comprehensive platform for digital asset data and consulting services for token issuers. I previously had a role as a lead data scientist at the blockchain analytics company Elementus. Before working in the blockchain data startup space, I was a senior data scientist and instructor at Metis Data Science Training. 

I've had a lot of fun and learned a lot over the years on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/aquatic), where I'm ranked as a competitions master.

I'm based in New York and love bouldering, reading, and playing piano.
