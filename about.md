I'm a data scientist in training, currently attending the Metis Bootcamp in NYC. I studied Math at Columbia as an undergrad, and after that went on to a brief stint in Healthcare consumer analytics at Crossix, followed by several years working as an equity research associate in US Equity Strategy at Credit Suisse. 

I also coach [NYU's Parli debate team](http://www.nyudebate.com/), having done competitive debate myself throughout high school and college.
