I'm a senior data scientist at [Metis Data Science Training](https://www.thisismetis.com/), where I teach 12-week bootcamps for students transitioning into data science, teach corporate training programs, and work on personal projects. I have a Mathematics degree from Columbia, and have experience in Healthcare consumer and finance analytics. Before joining Metis I worked as an equity research associate in US Equity Strategy at Credit Suisse. 

I also coach [NYU's Parli debate team](http://www.nyudebate.com/), having done competitive debate myself throughout high school and college. More recently, I've been getting my competitive kicks and learning a ton from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/aquatic).

Long term I'll likely be based in New York, but at the moment I'm enjoying the west coast weather while teaching in San Francisco.
