I'm a data science generalist with more than 7 years of experience in data science and analytics roles across blockchain tech, finance, and healthcare. I've been very focused on complex machine learning problems along with team leadership and mentorship. Most recently I led a data science team at a Series A blockchain analytics startup. Before that, I was a senior data scientist and instructor at Metis Data Science Training. 

I've had a lot of fun and learned a lot over the years on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/aquatic), where I'm ranked as a competitions master.

I'm based in New York and love bouldering, reading, and playing piano.
